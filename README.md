MediaElch
=========

MediaElch is a MediaManager for XBMC. It directly accesses XBMCs database (SQLite and MySQL) and thumbnail cache to store information about Movies and TV Shows. Or it just generates nfo files and stores posters, backdrops, thumbnails beside your Movies.
MediaElch is compatible with XBMC v11 "Eden". Using the nfo generator, MediaElch can be used with other MediaCenters as well.
